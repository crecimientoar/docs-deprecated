# What is Crecimiento?

Crecimiento is a transformative initiative with a singular goal:
To foster significant financial prosperity in Argentina through the development of startups and the creation of a conducive entrepreneurial environment. In alignment with the government's embrace of innovative technologies, including a strong national inclination towards crypto adoption, this movement seeks to leverage these advances.

## What is the strategy?

A dedicated hub operating over two years where both local and international innovators can develop new, crypto-focused technological products. This will be kick-started by a 'Pop-Up City'â€”the official launchpad for the movement, where all teams and interested participants will converge for a month-long event.
